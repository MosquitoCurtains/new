## Section 1: Our Work Environment

**Icon Suggestion:** Users

**Content:**
We are a small family business that started over a garage 16yrs ago. We now occupy a 16,000 sq ft facility in Alpharetta, GA with 20 fantastic hard working employees. The ethos of our work environment is to have fun while working hard together.

Those that upset the positive chemistry we've built here together are simply asked to leave. As the owner, my job is to protect everyone from toxic people that make others miserable. No one raises their voice here.

## Section 7: The Inception of a Dream

**Icon Suggestion:** Sparkles

**Content:**
The idea came to us in 1999 when we wanted to screen our own porch. We called a contractor who quoted us $4,000 to screen our porch. Considering what was involved to frame, prime, paint, frame a door, and screen it all, this seemed like a fair price. But I thought it was too much for something so temporal.

We knew there had to be a better way. I trekked off to the fabric store and bought some netting and webbing material. Unfortunately, fabric stores only carry 60″ wide goods, so we had to seam them vertically.
