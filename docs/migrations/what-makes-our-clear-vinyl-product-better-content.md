## Meticulous Construction Quality at a Better Price

- We have a perimeter webbing all double-stitched with UV protected marine-grade thread.
- We add a special hidden tape to prevent stitching from perforating the plastic you will never know is even there. Why? Because we know it matters years from now.
- We have excellent automation that enables us to keep our costs much lower with perfect stitching.

## Smarter Fastening System

This is NOT our Product

This is What We Do

- Our system is simple and not intrusive. If it is easy to hang and remove, you won’t require paying a fee to have a professional hang and remove AND you will be more inclined to remove them during the hot summer sun that will damage panels prematurely. Sometimes complicated & expensive isn’t better!
- We focus on what is important. Quality, Aesthetics & Performance at a Better Price!

## Better Quality Clear Vinyl Enclosure Materials

- Most folks like us in the industry use some version of 20 mil double-polished clear vinyl plastic, but not all CV is created equal.
- We have rare 72″ (tall) goods as opposed to most who have only 54″ goods. We have larger seamless windows and less production cost.
- We do not heat weld panels together because it is the first thing to fail.
- We don’t use cheap $2.85/yd plastic canvas aprons that look industrial and cheap.
- We use a waterproof canvas similar to a classy Gortex-like material that costs us $10.64/yd.

## More About Motorized Clear Vinyl Systems

- Very Large openings with little or no structural support. Sometimes you just need the clunky hardware others offer for severe wind loads
- Motorized Clear Vinyl Panels. They are incredible when done right but must be professionally installed and they cost a fortune. BE CAREFUL on these.
- For temperatures below -15° F (-26° C). You need a special supplier of 40 mil to avoid what is called cold cracking
- For those that want an overhead roof panel, Awning companies are better equipped for waterproofing roof panels that will drain properly.
- We want you to shop around because we are sassy and know we offer the best value.
- Hint: If you want to compare us, try your local awning company or check more online.
