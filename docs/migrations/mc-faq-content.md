## FAQ Categories & Questions

### Category: Ordering

1. **Is this a secure website?**
   We have several layers of security on this website to insure that we are squeaky clean. Our first layer is through our host "Liquid Web" which, by itself, has very robust security. You will also notice that the web site address has https:// (the "s" is for secure).

2. **What are the most common mistakes made when ordering?**
   Generally, 99% of folks do a very good job ordering online. A few forget to add IMPORTANT measurement adjustments. After all, curtains need to be a bit wider than your exposure so that we have enough fabric to seal the sides.

3. **Should I order online or over the phone?**
   We appreciate when clients order directly online since it greatly helps us to keep costs down. During the height of the season, we can get quite busy, and it really helps if you've read the web site so that you have a basic understanding of our system.

4. **What if I make a mistake?**
   We will correct the mistake and we don't ask who's fault it was. Sometimes we ask that you return the incorrect mosquito netting curtains back to us for a correction; and, sometimes we just start over.

5. **What is the difference between Raw Netting and a Mosquito Curtain?**
   Raw mosquito netting and raw no-see-um netting is just raw fabric with absolutely no means of attachment. Raw netting is often ordered by designers and folks that choose to fabricate their own solution.

6. **What is the difference between Mosquito Netting and No-see-um Netting?**
   If you don't have a nasty little biting fly called a no-see-um, order mosquito mesh. No-see-ums are smaller than gnats or black flies. If you don't know what a no-see-um is, you probably don't have them.

7. **What if I want to attach a note to my order?**
   When you check out, you will be directed to a page where you enter shipping and billing information. On this page, there is a "comments box" where you can add any additional details or give us your vision.

8. **Is tracking included in the order?**
   No. Optional curtain tracking hardware must be ordered on the online store. When you order tracking hardware, we configure your no-see-um or mosquito netting curtains for tracking attachment.

9. **What if I have non-rectangular shapes?**
   We have created worksheet links on the PLAN page of the web site addressing most non-rectangular situations. Sometimes the irregularities can get quite complex. We will need enough geometry to replicate your project.

10. **Is the curtain bound on all 4 sides?**
    Yes, unless for some reason, you request otherwise, we will bind all sides with a 2″ webbing folded like a "taco" with netting tucked inside and double stitched.

11. **Is there Velcro tape on the side bindings?**
    Not unless you request it. Generally, this is only a good idea if you have aluminum or vinyl siding. Otherwise, we STRONGLY suggest marine snaps.

12. **Do you put weights in the bottom of the curtain?**
    No. Outdoor curtains are different than indoor curtains and weights don't work outdoors. It is far more effective to use marine snaps strategically placed at the base of the curtain.

13. **Does the adhesive backed Velcro tape come with the order?**
    Yes. For orders with Velcro tape attachment we provide white adhesive-backed hook Velcro tape equal to the width of your curtain.

14. **What if I want to use curtain rods instead of your tracking?**
    We can sew rod pockets that you may insert a rod into, but before you try this method, read on. We have tested everything known to man and have found that rods and picture hanging wire just don't work as well.

15. **What if my dimensions are larger than what is available on the store page?**
    We routinely make curtains larger than what you may see on the web site. Our largest mosquito netting curtain panel to date has been 500ft wide x 38ft tall used as a warehouse partition. Call us, we'll figure it out.

16. **Do you sell netting replacements for a gazebo kit I bought somewhere else?**
    No, but we can certainly make custom mosquito netting or no-see-um netting curtains for you. Unfortunately, the stores that sell these gazebo kits lead you to believe you can get replacement parts, but good luck.

17. **How soon will I receive my order?**
    Despite the fact we make custom Mosquito Netting curtains, we are lightning fast. Orders are generally sent out in 1-3 days, and delivery time depends on where you live relative to Atlanta.

18. **Your store page only shows 8 orderable panels, how do I order more?**
    After ordering your first 8 panels, you will be directed to the shopping cart to view your entry. CLICK the "keep shopping" button and order more panels.

19. **What if I'm not happy with the product?**
    Please return it within 4 weeks for a full refund of your purchase price less shipping charges. See our guarantee.

20. **Is this product made in America?**
    Everything except the neodymium magnets. We loom, fabricate, and purchase everything else in the USA. We have not found a domestic supplier of neodymium magnets that offers product made in the USA.

21. **Can I have the names of your competitors?**
    While we have a patent on our methods, there should be no one that does what we do the way we do it. WE ARE THE SOURCE FOR CORRECT ANSWERS.

22. **Can you give me the name of a client in my area so I can see the product?**
    I'm sorry, but we protect the privacy of our clients. Would you want some stranger coming over to your house? If you would like a sample package of the netting, please email us with your address.

23. **Is there a difference in visibility between Heavy Mesh and Standard Mesh?**
    No. We have adjusted the hole count on the Heavy Mesh to 230 holes per square inch to make the Heavy Mesh appear identical to the Standard Mesh at 270 holes per inch. You can feel a difference but the visibility is the same.

### Category: After You've Ordered

24. **I've received my tracking but my curtains have not arrived?**
    Orders with tracking come in 2 boxes that typically arrive same day. Every now and then, the boxes arrive on different days.

25. **How do I care for my curtains?**
    Curtains like to be washed at least once a year to remove any dirt. Washing your curtains will extend the life of your curtains. A great time to do so is when the bug season is over.

26. **Can I be a reseller of your product?**
    Yes. There is value helping clients plan and install mosquito netting curtains. You may direct prospective clients to www.outdoorcurtain.com which has only our photo gallery and no company information.

### Category: Planning

27. **How many panels should I order?**
    You want to minimize the number of panels whenever possible. Introduce a new panel only where you need a doorway, have an obstruction, or are trying to create a certain swagging configuration.

28. **What if I need help measuring?**
    Keep this theme in mind. Your curtains need to be wider than your actual exposure so that you can seal the sides. In addition, we are working with textiles so there is a bit of variance.
    - Width Adjustment: We recommend adding 3″ per panel + 1″ per 10ft of width.
    - Height Adjustment: No adjustment for tracking / 2″ taller than your exposed opening for Velcro Attachment.

29. **Should I use an inside hang or outside hang?**
    Typically this is only relevant when a curtain panel turns a corner. Velcro attachment generally uses an outside hang (a path around the OUTSIDE of support columns) while tracking attachment generally uses an inside hang.

### Category: Installation

30. **Is this difficult to install? How long? What tools?**
    Curtains are installed with minimal home improvement skills. Can you stand on a ladder and hold a drill? If the answer is yes, you're in business. Most describe it as a fun little half day project.

31. **I'm not very handy. Do you have someone who can install this for me?**
    We emphasize that the product is easy to self install; however, if you are not so inclined, any handyman can easily handle the installation.

32. **Is the tracking side mounted or under mounted?**
    The tracking is designed to be under mounted; however you can always side mount a wood strip and then undermount the track to the wood strip.

33. **Is there tracking that runs along the floor?**
    No. Our tracking isn't designed that way and you would only trip over floor tracking.

34. **Why do I have to place marine snaps and magnets?**
    Great question. First, early on we tried to do this for customers but it is far more complicated than it may seem. These items aren't difficult to place. In fact, we have a video of a 9-year old showing you how. It is easy.

35. **What if I need non-rectangular curtain panels?**
    You will need to phone in the geometry and we will help you. Give us a call at 770-884-7705.

### Category: Special Situations

36. **Will Mosquito Netting Curtains contain my pets?**
    It depends on the situation. Email us with your situation, and we will provide guidance. Our most durable material is our double thread weight HEAVY mosquito netting mesh.

37. **What if I don't have a roof?**
    Check out some of our screened in deck ideas (open deck with no covered roof).

38. **Do you carry flexible track for a large radius arc?**
    Our track is pre-bent using a 12in. radius. If you have a broader arc with a wider radius, check out this alternative track at www.konnectinternational.com.

39. **Do you make Curtains for umbrellas?**
    Not any more. There are other companies who specialize in this sort of thing like gardenwinds.com. If you are after super quality, try www.BugUmbrella.com.

40. **Do You Offer Motorized Solutions?**
    No. However, we highly recommend the folks at Southern Patio Enclosures who only work on Commercial Applications.
