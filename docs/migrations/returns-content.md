### Product Care Notes

The mosquito netting and no-see-um netting are high quality fabrics, but with limits:
- A weed eater will definitely make a hole
- Raking the netting repeatedly against a stucco corner, or rose bushes will cause damage

Clear Vinyl panels are perfectly dense and should be:
- Removed in heavy winds over 25mph
- Will crack if manipulated at temperatures below minus 10-degrees F

### Measurement Warning

We ask you to please be careful with your measurements! We recognize that ordering such a product online is new to many of you and perhaps a bit of a challenge. If there are any mis-cuts, we resolve them quickly.
