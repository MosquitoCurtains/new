## Section 1: Pontoon Boat Netting

**Icon Suggestion:** Anchor / Ship

**Content:**
Sometimes simplest is best. Just throw a large super quality netting sheet over your bimini and tie it off. Focus on quality netting rather than costly fabricated solutions (we do, too).

An old boy scout trick is to drape the netting over a golf ball or cork, tie a slip knot, and then tie the other end to anything you want like an improvised weight or tie it off to available rigging.

This is quality marine-grade polyester netting that will not unravel when cut or fade. Give us a call, we'll talk you through measurements and a good strategy. 770-645-4745

**Mesh Types & Colors:**
- Mosquito Mesh – Black / White / Ivory
- No-see-um Mesh – Black / White
- Shade Mesh – Black / White

**Image Gallery Labels:**
- Tied at Corners
- Fully Screened In
- Just a Throw Sheet
- Customized
- A Night on the Lake

## Section 2: Houseboat Porch Screens

**Icon Suggestion:** Home

**Content:**
Some houseboats have a porch that is no different than a porch on a house. We will need to assist you. Contact us through our contact form with images or a model number so we can find a stock image.

## Section 3: Boat Dock Screens

**Icon Suggestion:** Warehouse

**Content:**
We can help you keep your boat clean with a custom-made enclosure for your boat dock! Also saves you from getting eaten alive while you're trying to clean up after a day on the lake.

---

## Section 4: Sail Boats And Cruisers

**Icon Suggestion:** Sailboat

**Content:**
This is where it gets very tricky as many shapes are very odd. At times, not only are the cuts unusual, but the surfaces are often not even planar, having a three dimensional bubble. The best way to approach is to contact us.

---

## Section 5: Rig it Yourself – Less Expensive Approach

**Icon Suggestion:** Scissors

**Content:**
Think of your boat net from a practical point of view. Likely, you aren't trying to win any beauty contest, you just want to be able to enjoy a cold drink on your boat as the sun sets without biting insects.

An old boyscout trick is to drape the netting over a golf ball, tie a slip knot, and then tie the other end to anything you want like an improvised weight or tie it off to available rigging. A "Throw Sheet" approach works well.

This is quality netting that will not unravel when cut and uses the same solution dyed process that Sunbrella uses on their fabrics for maximum fade resistance. Give us a call with your boat model.

## Section 6: A Cool Idea for Windows

**Icon Suggestion:** Lightbulb

**Content:**
This client wanted Insect Curtain Panels. Rather than make entire panels, we suggested cutting out the current plastic from the canvas. Any tailor could sew Velcro to the canvas. So long as it is angular and planar, we can make a panel to Velcro™ into the opening.

Cheap because it's the canvas and the customization of getting everything to line up with the boat fasteners that is expensive… and you have INTERCHANGEABLE panels for BOTH cool weather and the summer months.
